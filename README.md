# E Commerce Back End 
Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.

This project demonstrates the back end for an e-commerce site, created by modifying starter code. 

# Getting Started 
Run the program by opening the server.js file in an integrated terminal and calling the command "nodemon server" in the terminal. The starter code has been modified to only require this command to create tables, seed the datebases, and start the program. 

Routes should be tested using Insomnia or other similar platform..

# Technologies Used 
This program was created using Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Routes are tested using Insomnia.
